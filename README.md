# Diabetes-Prediction
In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we perform a Random Forest machine learning model on the basis of the accuracy_score metric.
